Hare and Tortoise simulation

The hare and the tortoise are having a race.
The race is 1000m. The hare is quick, but lazy, often stopping to have a rest. The tortoise is slow, but steady, and keeps going at more or less the same pace.
The race is divided into "rounds" which repeat until one of the creatures completes 1000m
There is a 25% chance each round that the hare will stop for a rest and not move at all
The winner is announced at the end of the race
It is possible (but unlikely!) that there may be a draw
For each round that he doesn't rest, the hare's desire to take a nap goes up 15%
After a rest, the nap chance is rest to 0%
The user can determine the base speeds of the hare and the tortoise
